# MyReads Project

This uses code from https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

This project is a application that contains mutiple shelves containing books.
The different rows is "Current Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read". The books can be pressed on through the button on the lower right corner. It will give the option to move it to an different shelf, or not move at all.

To add a new book you can press the "Add a block" link in the lower right hand corner of the brower. It will open the search bar. You can search for an book and then you can press on the button on the lower right hand corner of an book to move it into the book shelves you own.

To return from the search bar to your shelves just press the button with the arrow key symbol in the upper left hand corner of the browser.

## Set up and start

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
